	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>The Chinese zodiac is the classification scheme that assigns an animal to each year in a repeating twelve-year cycle. 
	The 12-year cycle of Chinese zodiac is an approximation to the 11.86-year cycle of Jupiter, the largest planet of the 
	solar system. There is a similar concept in western astrology and means "circle of animals". It is a scheme and systematic 
	plan of future action that relates each year to an animal and its reputed attributes according to a 12-year cycle. It 
	remains popular in several East Asian countries including China, Vietnam, Korea, Japan, Philippines, Thailand and Taiwan.</p>
	<h3>Similarities with Western Zodiac</h3>
	<p>Identifying this scheme using the term "zodiac" reflects several similarities to the Western zodiac: both have time 
	cycles divided into 12 parts, each labels at least the majority of those parts with names of animals, and each is widely 
	associated with a culture of ascribing a person's personality or events in his or her life to the supposed influence of 
	the person's particular relationship to the cycle. Nevertheless, there are major differences: the Chinese 12-part cycle 
	corresponds to years, rather than months. The Chinese zodiac is represented by 12 animals, whereas some of the signs in 
	the Western zodiac are not animals, despite the implication of the Greek etymology of "zodiac". The animals of the Chinese
	zodiac are not associated with constellations spanned by the ecliptic plane.</p>
