	I think we completed everything in the pdf and checked it with the marking guide.
	What I feel challenging is the details in decorating the web pages. CSS has many different tags and ways to do the formatting and it's 
	hard to know them in a short time.
	We tried our best to make the pages beautiful and keep the files organized, though it's not as pretty as we planned.

	Complying with the XHTML 1.0 standard was also difficult.
